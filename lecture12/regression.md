### Which of the following is true about the slope coefficient in a simple linear regression model?

A. It represents the average value of the dependent variable.

B. It represents the change in the dependent variable for a one-unit increase in the independent variable.

C. It represents the standard deviation of the dependent variable.

D. It represents the correlation between the dependent and independent variables.

### In linear regression, what is the variable that we are trying to predict called?

A. Independent variable

B. Dependent variable

C. Control variable

D. Confounding variable

### What is the purpose of hypothesis testing in linear regression?

A. To estimate the parameters of the regression equation.

B. To determine whether there is a significant relationship between the independent and dependent variables.

C. To determine the value of the intercept in the regression equation.

D. To determine the value of the slope in the regression equation.

### In hypothesis testing for linear regression, what is the null hypothesis?

A. There is no significant relationship between the independent and dependent variables.

B. There is a significant relationship between the independent and dependent variables.

C. The slope of the regression line is zero.

D. The intercept of the regression line is zero.

### What does the R-squared value tell us about a linear regression model?

A. The strength of the relationship between the independent and dependent variables.

B. The average error in the predicted values.

C. The proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variable.

D. The proportion of the variance in the independent variable that is explained by the dependent variable.

### What is the range of possible values for R-squared?

A. -1 to 1

B. 0 to 1

C. 0 to infinity

D. -infinity to infinity

### How does a smaller standard error of the estimate affect the quality of the linear regression model?

A. It indicates a stronger relationship between the independent and dependent variables.

B. It indicates a weaker relationship between the independent and dependent variables.

C. It indicates a larger amount of unexplained variance in the dependent variable.

D. It indicates a smaller amount of unexplained variance in the dependent variable.
