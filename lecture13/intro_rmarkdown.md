# Lecture 13 Intro to R Markdown

## Creating an R Markdown file

In RStudio, choose File --> R Markdown

Now you have access to an R Markdown file. You can try editing the text outside of the gray code blocks. 

## Editing Markdown

Try adding some more headings to the document, and a few words of text under each heading. The number of # signs before the heading name indicates its size (the more #, the smaller it will be).

# `#` Header 1

Section 1 here

## `##` Header 2

Subsection here

### `###` Header 3

Subsubsection here

#### `####` Header 4

Subsubsubsection here

## Editing code

You can add a new code block by clicking the +c button on the top bar, and choosing R:

Try writing a line of code to execute here, for example add a few numbers together.

## Creating the finished file

Choose the "Knit" button on the top bar to create the finished file. You can choose what kind of file output you want each time you knit your file (I recommend html).

## Challenge

If you have extra time, try out more sophisticated markdown formatting: https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf. These are all techniques that can help make your final reports more polished.

1. Write a sentence with one word bolded and one word in italics.
2. Add a hyperlink to a webpage. 
3. Add a table.
4. Add an inline equation.
5. Create a bulleted list.
6. Create a numbered list.
