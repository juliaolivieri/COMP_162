# Statistical analysis of data

**Note: The happiness score is a function of the other variables, so we can focus on relationships between the other variables**

1. Analyze the correlations in the data.
* Perform pairwise correlations between a subset of the quantitative variables using Pearson's coefficient.
* Perform pairwise correlations between a subset of the quantitative variables using Spearman's coefficient.
* Subset the data to a specific region, and check for correlations.
2. In R Markdown write down any observations you have.
3. Develop hypotheses you want to test using the data. Write them in your R Markdown file.
* Come up with at least 1 hypothesis that involves comparing two quantitative variables.
* Come up with at least 1 hypothesis that involves comparing a quantitative variable and a binary variable (note: to do this, you'll have to choose two `Region`s to focus on, since none of our variables are binary).
4. Perform hypothesis tests for these hypotheses.
* Remember, we've learned how to run linear models and t tests in R
5. Write down your conclusions in R Markdown.
6. Create a plot to emphasize each of your conclusions.
